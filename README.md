# Shadow-Door-Puzzle-Game
Shadow Door Puzzle

Shadow Door Puzzle is a small terminal-based guessing game built in Python. The idea is straightforward: three doors, one shadow, and a clue that may or may not help you figure out where the shadow is hiding. The clues change each round, so the game doesn’t feel repetitive.

# How the Game Works

When the game starts, you’ll see three door options: Red, Blue, and Green.
The program secretly assigns the shadow to one door. Before you choose, it gives you a hint. The hint might refer to:

The first letter of the shadow's door

A random letter that appears in a safe door

The reversed spelling of the shadow's door

Your goal is to interpret the clue and pick a door that doesn’t hide the shadow. If you pick the wrong door, the game ends. If you pick a safe one, you continue to the next round.
